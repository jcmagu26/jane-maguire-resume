# Jane Maguire – Resume

Hi! I'm a Data Science major at Colby College with minors in Mathematics and Environmental Science. I am a student-athlete on the Women’s Soccer Team and have been awarded NESCAC and CSC All-Academic recognition. I also am a team representative on the Student Athlete Advisory Committee, where I help advocate for student-athlete wellbeing and boost communication between teams and administration.

My courseload spans statistics, computer science, mathematics, GIS, and applied data analysis, including courses taken abroad at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia. Through internships at The Andover Companies and TekScan, I’ve applied my skills in Tableau, R, Power BI, and other modeling tools to build dashboards and predictive models that drive business decisions.
